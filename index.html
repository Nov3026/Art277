    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
    <!--This Is The First Paragrahy-->
    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and<br> typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the<br>
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and<br>
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br>
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of<br>
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like<br>
        <i><b><u>Aldus PageMaker</u></b></i> including versions of <u>Lorem Ipsum</u>. <br><b>1914 translation by H. Rackham</b>
    </p><br><br><br><br>

    <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
    <!--This Is The Second Paragraph-->
    <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted<br> by the readable content of a page when looking at its<br>
        layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less<br> normal distribution of letters, as opposed
        to using<br> “Content here, content here”, making it look like readable English.<br> Many desktop publishing
        packages and web page editors now use<br> Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for “lorem<br>
        Ipsum” will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br>Various versions have evolved over the years,<br>
        sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <br>(injected humour and the like).
    </p>

    <h1>Where can I get some?</h1>
    <!--This Is The Third Paragraph-->
    <p><b>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum <br>available, 
        but the majority have suffered
        alteration in some form, <br>by injected humour, or <u>randomized words
        </u> which don't look<br> even slightly believable.</b>
         If you are going to use a passage<br> of Lorem Ipsum, you need to 
         be sure there isn't anything<br>
        embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <i>All the Lorem Ipsum<br>
             generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks
            <br> as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.</i>
         <br>It uses a dictionary of over
        200 Latin words, combined  <br>with a handful of model sentence structures,
         <br> to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
        reasonable.  <br>The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
         <br>free from repetition, injected humour, or non</p>
